this site will be designed to allow for photographers to critique each other's work through a very simple "who wins"
process, similar to hot or not:
1) two images are shown, at random, side by side, from a given category.
2) the viewer picks one of them for being "better" (better being subjective, of course)
3) the site keeps track of the most winning and the most losing photos.
Repeat forever.

Components:

A web front-end (resolution agnostic, responsive design, angular or similar, should be scalable to phones on up)
    Main view, which shows two images side by side
        Category name
        No author information, date taken, or name of the photographer/photo (to prevent gaming/biases)
        The images are clickable
            Clicking either image causes:
                A reload of the page with two new randomly selected images
                A SQL table update to tally the win and loss
        The category name is clickable / dropdown
            Shows other categories available (landscape, portrait, street, etc)
    Top score tables, sorted by winning percentage
        One for each category
        Images displayed in a column, can be clicked to expand
            Includes photo name, artist
    User management (use off the shelf django if possible)
        Login
            Real name, email address, link to portfolio
        Signup
        Admin-facing vetting process for portfolio (make sure they're a real photographer)
        Admin tool for reviewing reported photos (illegal content, copyright violations)
        Banning/removal of users
    User image uploads
        Simple gallery front-end displaying uploaded images in thumbnail format
        Upload tool
            Images limited to 2048 on the long side. Scaled dynamically in web viewer based on screen size
    Email servicing (off the shelf if possible)
        Signup
        Forgot password
        Admin mail (you've been banned, etc)
    Post MVP: discussion forum (off the shelf or a simple home-grown one?)
    Post MVP: Peanut Gallery, which allows the public to vote (separate tally)
    Ad network to make some money
        Ad-free version for nominal fee, plus other goodies (more images can be uploaded, forum perks, etc)

A database-driven back-end
    SQL of some sort with a few small tables:
        Users (name, userID, email, portfolio, number of images uploaded)
        Photos (photoID, filename/path, userID, wins, losses, category)
        Categories (name, categoryID)

Cleanup: Once a month, bottom percentage (10%?) deleted
